# T7 Patch Loader
Are you too lazy to press two buttons to open and close t7patch? Well don't you worry because T7 Patch Loader is here to do the job for you!

T7 Patch Loader is a python-based application which allows t7patch and Black Ops 3 to open and close simultaneously when clicking on the shortcut or .vbs file generated by this application.

### DISCLAIMER: This application has only been tested on Windows.

# Instructions
1. Download [the zip](https://github.com/notspyral/t7patchloader/releases/tag/Current).
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Open the executable.
4. Follow the instructions in the command prompt.

# Known Bugs
1. Some t7patch files get created wherever the shortcut is located. I will try to fix this in the next update.

# How it Works

The executable is a bundled python script which, when going through the instructions, creates a folder, the scripts inside the folder, and a shortcut leading to the script. The first script is **"t7patchbooter.bat".** This script simply opens t7patch then Black Ops 3 shortly after. Then it checks every 5 seconds if Black Ops 3 is still open, and closes it if that check is unsucessful. The next script is **batloader.vbs.** This one just opens the .bat file without having a command prompt open.
