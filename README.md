# T7 Patch Loader
Are you too lazy to press two buttons to open and close t7patch? Well don't you worry because T7 Patch Loader is here to do the job for you!

T7 Patch Loader is a python-based application which allows t7patch and Black Ops 3 to open and close simultaneously when clicking on the shortcut generated by this application.

# Instructions
1. Download [either the gui or nongui version zip](https://github.com/notspyral/t7patchloader/releases/tag/Current) (GUI version is newer and easier).
2. Extract the zip 
3. Open the executable.
4. Follow the instructions on the application/command prompt.

# How it Works

The executable is a bundled python script which, when going through the instructions, creates a folder, the scripts inside the folder, and a shortcut leading to the script. The first script is **"t7patchbooter.bat".** This script simply opens t7patch then Black Ops 3 shortly after. Then it checks every 5 seconds if Black Ops 3 is still open, and then closes t7patch if it detects that Black Ops 3 is not open. The next script is **batloader.vbs.** This one just opens the .bat file without having a command prompt open. The new GUI version works the same except with a better looking interface and the ability to browse for files.
