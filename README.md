# T7 Patch Loader

# PLEASE READ: As of version 2.03, t7patch can now be loaded directly from bo3's directory, thus making this application obsolete. However, if you are still using the application version of t7patch for whatever reason, this application will still work with it.

Are you too lazy to press two buttons to open and close t7patch? Well don't you worry because T7 Patch Loader is here to do the job for you!

T7 Patch Loader is a python-based application which allows t7patch and Black Ops 3 to open and close simultaneously when clicking on the shortcut generated by this application.

### DISCLAIMER: This application has only been tested on Windows.

# Instructions
1. Download [the zip](https://github.com/notspyral/t7patchloader/releases/tag/Current)
2. Extract the zip 
3. Open the executable.
4. Follow the instructions on the application/command prompt.

# How it Works

The executable is a bundled python script which, when going through the instructions, creates a folder, the scripts inside the folder, and a shortcut leading to the script. The first script is **"t7patchbooter.bat".** This script simply opens t7patch then Black Ops 3 shortly after. Then it checks every 5 seconds if Black Ops 3 is still open, and then closes t7patch if it detects that Black Ops 3 is not open. The next script is **batloader.vbs.** This one just opens the .bat file without having a command prompt open.
